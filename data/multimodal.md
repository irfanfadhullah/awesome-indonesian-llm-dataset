## Conceptual Captions 12M

[[Original Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-12m)]

[[Update Link for Download](https://stor.akmal.dev/cc12m.jsonl.zst)]

Conceptual 12M (CC12M), a dataset with ~12 million image-text pairs meant to be used for vision-and-language pre-training. It is larger and covers a much more diverse set of visual concepts than the Conceptual Captions (CC3M), a dataset that is widely used for pre-training and end-to-end training of image captioning models. Check our paper for further details.

## MSVD-Indonesian

MSVD-Indonesian (Paper: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11341)) is derived from the MSVD dataset, which is obtained with the help of a machine translation service. This dataset can be used for multimodal video-text tasks, including text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Same as the original English dataset, the MSVD-Indonesian dataset contains about 80k video-text pairs.

### Data

## IndoCareer

### Introduction

IndoCareer is a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law.

## Data
Each question in the dataset is a multiple-choice question with up to 5 choices and only one choice as the correct answer. 

```
import datasets
data = datasets.load_dataset('indolem/IndoCareer', 'all')
```

## Examples

These questions are written in Indonesian.

## IndoMMLU

### Introduction

We introduce IndoMMLU, the first multi-task language understanding benchmark for Indonesian culture and languages, 
which consists of questions from primary school to university entrance exams in Indonesia. By employing professional teachers, 
we obtain 14,906 questions across 63 tasks and education levels, with 46\% of the questions focusing on assessing proficiency 
in the Indonesian language and knowledge of nine local languages and cultures in Indonesia.

### Subjects

 | Level     | Subjects                           | 
 |-----------|------------------------------------|
 | SD (Primary School)  | Science, Social science, Civics, Indonesian Language, Balinese, Makassarese, Banjarese, Lampungic, Madurese, Sundanese, Javanese, Dayak Ngaju, Minangkabau culture, Art, Sports, Islam religion, Christian religion, Hindu religion |
 | SMP (Junior High School) | Science, Social science, Civics, Indonesian Language, Balinese, Makassarese, Banjarese, Lampungic, Madurese, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau culture, Art, Sports, Islam religion, Christian religion, Hindu religion |

### Examples

These questions are written in Indonesian. For local language subjects, some are written in the local languages. The English version is for illustrative purposes only.

</p>

### Evaluation

We evaluate 24 multilingual LLMs of different sizes in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This includes [GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT)](https://chat.openai.com/), [XGLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10668), [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae/), [BLOOMZ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz), [mT0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz), [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), and [Bactrian-X](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/bactrian-x). Prior to the question and multiple-choice options, we add a simple prompt in the Indonesian language:

```
 Ini adalah soal [subject] untuk [level]. Pilihlah salah satu jawaban yang dianggap benar!
 English Translation: This is a [subject] question for [level]. Please choose the correct answer!
```

In In Proceedings of Commonsense Representation and Reasoning Workshop 2022 (**CSRR at ACL 2022**), Dublin, Ireland. 

### Dataset

A story in our dataset consists of four-sentence premise, one-sentence correct ending, and one-sentence incorrect ending. In total, we have created 2,325 Indonesian stories with the train/dev/test split 1,000/200/1,135. Please see some examples of our data below, and note that the English translation is only for the illustratrive purposes.
